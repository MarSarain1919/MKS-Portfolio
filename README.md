# MKS-Portfolio
This is a webpage portfolio to which I will add my future web application projects.

In this project, I built this website from scratch using html and advanced CSS. The goal was to create a page to which I will further develop as I gain more skills. 

This site is comprised of:
    - a header containing a nav bar
    - a body of content including a short personal bio, project placeholders, a contact me portion, and a resume download link (that I unsuccessfully linked)
    - a footer with a message
    - media queries to demonstrate understanding of window size change
